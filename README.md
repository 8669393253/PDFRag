# PDFRag
This project allows users to interact with PDF documents by asking questions and receiving context-aware answers. The system extracts text from PDFs, embeds the content using a transformer model, stores and retrieves embeddings using FAISS, and generates responses using the Groq API with LLaMA 3 models.
